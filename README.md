# Professional ReadMe Generator


  ## Description
  -My motivation for the project was simply to make future projects take less time to assemble.
  -The reasoning behind the project was to make it easier to create ReadMe files for future use.
  -The problem that is solved is having to create a ReadMe file from scratch everytime there is a new project.
  -I learned how to create new functions using node and how this can be used to create other files using this similar structure.
